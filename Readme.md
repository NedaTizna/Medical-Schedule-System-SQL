# MedSched (Medical Scheduling System)

A SQL-based medical scheduling system that manages doctors, patients, and their weekly appointments.  
This database project is designed for clinics or hospitals to easily keep track of doctors’ schedules and patients' bookings.

## Features
- Store doctors with their specialties.
- Store patient contact information.
- Schedule appointments for doctors and patients by day and time.
- Sample data for 5 doctors, 10 patients, and a weekly schedule.
- Easy-to-use queries for:
  - Viewing all doctors
  - Viewing all patients
  - Viewing the full weekly schedule
  - Viewing specific doctor’s patients on a given day
## How It Works
1. Doctors and Patients are stored in separate tables.  
2. Schedule table connects doctors to patients with a specific day and time.  
3. The project uses foreign keys to maintain data integrity.  
4. Sample data includes:
   - 5 doctors with different specialties
   - 10 patients with phone numbers
   - A weekly schedule (Monday to Friday)
